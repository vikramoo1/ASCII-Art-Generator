# ASCII-Art-Generator
 ASCII is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers. Butâ€¦what if we use this for something other than text? How about images!
 
## ASCII art
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for pre0sentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII).
The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general.

### Uses
ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, teleprinters, non-graphic computer terminals,etc.
Early computer games played on terminals frequently used ASCII art to simulate graphics, most notably the roguelike genre using ASCII art to visually represent dungeons and monsters within them.


#### Image to text conversion
Programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of vector quantization. A method is to sample the image down to grayscale with less than 8-bit precision, and then assign a character for each value. Such ASCII art generators often allow users to choose the intensity and contrast of the generated image.

##### How to run the the project
The necessary python files are being added in the repository.
